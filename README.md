# BQ_PROJECT - UC Irvine Data Science Major Capstion Project (Partner Company - BrightQuery Inc.)
Setup:
1. In this project, we did the public financial perforance prediction using Temporal-Fushion Transformer Model.
2. Before you run the notebook code: please first go to this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I6Z-60iJqEU9jkXmWRc6UT06kRcm2mkO?usp=sharing.
3. The link showing above is our shared cloud Google Drive folder which contains our preprocessed data and relevant information of our project.
4. After you opened this link and got into this folder, please add this folder as a short-cut to your Google Drive you usually use.
5. Once, the folder is added to your Google MyDrive, then you can start run the notebook on colab.
6. It's important to run the colab notebook with the GPU, otherwise, the Temporal-Fusion Transformer cannot run.
7. Also, it's important to run the notebook by signing in with your correct Google account, which links with the Google Drive folder that contains the data files.
8. Once all setup showing above is done, you can run all the notebook files.

File Description:
1. BQ_LinearRegression.ipynb: Notebook contains the code for training the simple time-series model using linear regression.
2. Report_Data_Management.ipynb: Notebook contains the code for preprocessing, and managing the raw data for the project.
3. Data_3000.csv: The processed data for modelling which has the sample size of 3000
